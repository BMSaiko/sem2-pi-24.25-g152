# US31 – Statistical Analysis of the Best-Fitting Curve for Execution Times

The dataset analyzed in this user story originates from integration tests conducted as part of US29. This dataset combines the execution time results obtained from US14 and US13.

Each test case was executed five times per 11 given datasets in moodle, then the saved result was the mean of the 5 results. 


In US14, the Fleury algorithm was implemented to identify Eulerian paths within railway graphs. As the Fleury algorithm operates with polynomial time complexity O(n<sup>2</sup>), we anticipate that the execution time will exhibit a quadratic growth pattern as the input size increases.

To achieve this, we loaded the dataset and applied a quadratic regression model (time = a * size² + b * size + c) using Python's scipy library. This allowed us to calculate the best-fitting curve that mathematically describes the relationship between input size and time.


In the PI topic a quadratric regression is not taught, but a simple Google search was made to understand how a linear regression would not apply in this case and how we could apply it here.
