# 📈 US31 - Statistical Analysis of Cargo Impact on Revenue

## 🎯 Objectives and Theoretical Concepts

This analysis seeks to **determine which cargo type contributes most significantly to the revenue** of a given station during a specific year. Using statistical techniques, we identify the cargo most strongly correlated with revenue and apply a **simple linear regression model** to quantify and forecast this relationship.

### 🔬 Key Concepts

- **Simple Linear Regression**  
  The goal is to model the relationship between the independent variable $X$ (cargo volume) and the dependent variable $Y$ (revenue):

  $$
  Y = \beta_0 + \beta_1 X + \varepsilon
  $$

  Where:
    - $Y$: Dependent variable (revenue)
    - $X$: Independent variable (cargo volume)
    - $\beta_0$: Intercept
    - $\beta_1$: Slope
    - $\varepsilon$: Random error term

- **Pearson Correlation Coefficient ($r$)**  
  Measures the linear relationship between $X$ and $Y$:

  $$
  r = \frac{S_{xy}}{\sqrt{S_{xx} \cdot S_{yy}}}
  $$

    - $r \in [-1, 1]$
    - A value near 1 or -1 indicates a strong correlation.

- **Sum of Squared Errors (SQE)**  
  Measures the discrepancy between actual and predicted values:

  $$
  SQE = \sum (y_i - \hat{y}_i)^2
  $$

- **Confidence Interval (CI)**  
  A 95% CI for prediction provides a range within which a future observation is expected to fall:

  $$
  \hat{y}_0 \pm t_{\alpha/2, n-2} \cdot \sqrt{s^2 \left(1 + \frac{1}{n} + \frac{(x_0 - \bar{x})^2}{S_{xx}}\right)}
  $$

## 📊 Results and Interpretation

### Summary of Findings

- **Most Correlated Cargo**: **Cereals**
- **Pearson’s |r|**: **0.9442** (Very strong positive correlation)
- **Linear Regression Model**:

  $$
  \text{Revenue} = 115.16 + 0.49 \cdot \text{Cereals}
  $$

- **Sum of Squared Errors (SQE)**: **27247.59**

### Forecast for January (Next Year)

- **Scenario**: 10% increase in cereals
- **Forecasted Revenue**: **€592.84k**
- **95% Confidence Interval**: **[€442.64k, €743.03k]**

### Analysis

The correlation of 0.9442 between cereal volume and revenue suggests a **highly linear relationship**, meaning cereals are a **key driver** of revenue for this station. The regression slope of 0.49 implies that every additional unit of cereals generates approximately **€0.49k** in revenue. The relatively low SQE value reinforces the model’s accuracy. The forecast and CI are especially useful for **strategic planning** in the simulation, helping players estimate potential revenue from modifying cargo volumes.

## 🚂 Extrapolation to the PI Context

In the scope of the PI (Integrative Project), this analysis demonstrates the value of **data-driven decisions** in railway network operations. The following extrapolations apply:

- **Scenario Planning**: Simulating cargo increases (e.g., cereals) can help optimize revenue.
- **Operational Strategies**: Stations near cereal-producing industries should be prioritized for upgrades or increased frequency of train service.
- **Gameplay Decisions**: Players can rely on statistical feedback to choose optimal cargo types and train routes.
- **Educational Insight**: Highlights the practical application of computational mathematics within a simulation environment.

This work aligns with the goals of integrating statistical methods with railway simulation to support economic and logistical decisions in the software solution.
