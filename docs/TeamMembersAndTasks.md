# LEI-ISEP 2nd Semester Integrative Project

# 1. Team Members

The team is formed by the students identified in the following table.

| Student Number | Name           |
|----------------|----------------|
| **1221514**    | Bruno Silva    |
| **1221515**    | Carlos Almeida |
| **1210491**    | Eduardo Costa  |
| **1221519**    | João Barroso   |
| **1221526**    | Miguel Pinto   |

# 2. Task Distribution

Throughout the project development period, the distribution of _tasks/requirements/features_ among team members was
carried out as described in the table below.

Please notice that in every sprint there are:

- some tasks that **must be** carried out by all members as a **team**, in full cooperation. Those tasks are team
  responsibility and each member has the duty to positively contribute to its accomplishment;
- other tasks, related to the SDP activities in the scope of a single US, must be carried out mainly by a single team
  member. I.e. such US tasks are the responsibility of a particular team member.

Despite this separation of responsibilities, **all team members must work in cooperation and help each other as a team
**.
Furthermore, it is worth noticing that all members should have knowledge/competencies about the entire project and not
just about his/her part of the project.

At last, remember that each User Story does not stand alone... it needs to be integrated with the remainders. Again, *
*integration** is a team responsibility.

**This table must be always up-to-date.**
